# 75thOfMarch

## Goal

March 2020 was when time stopped meaning anything.

It's time we acknowledge the truth: March 2020 will never end.

## Project Setup

None.  This is the real deal folks: static, hand-crafted HTML in the tradtion of https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ and http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/.

## TODO

1. ✔ Basic HTML Page of the format:
  ```
  Is March over yet?
  NOPE

  It's the
  75th
  of March 2020

  It's a Friday.
  Time means nothing.

  ```
2. ✔ Sprinkle in some vanilla AF javascript to fill in the weekday and numeric date
3. Write some automated tests for generating the "75th" part, especially "th", vs "rd", etc.
4. Write some automated tests for the Friday part?
5. ✔ Google Analytics
6. A nice vcard share things for Twitter/Facebook
7. Share with the internet
8. Maybe add a Twitter share button?
9. Possibly, also check to see if it looks like shit in IE.
